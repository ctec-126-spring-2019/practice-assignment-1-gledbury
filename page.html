    <h3>Info about me</h3>
    <p>Hello.  My name is George Ledbury and i am 52 years old.  I have been married to my wife Michele for 20 years.  I have a 11 year old son named Jack.
    </p>
    <h3>Hoping to Accomplish</h3>
    <p>I would like to be able to know and understand the basics of Javascript after taking this class. Maybe I will be able to get another Certification.
    </p>
    <h3>Progamming Experience</h3>
    <p>I am a beginner programmer.  Last term I took the Intro to Python class as well as the HTML class. I enjoyed both classes but the HTML class was definately the easier of the two.  Although HTML is technically called markup and not code I will include it in the list of programming languages I know below.
    </p>

        <li>Python</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
    </ul>
